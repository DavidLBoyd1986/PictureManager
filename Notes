TODO:

1. Create a Pipeline
2. Add in actual testing
    * The data set to test against is large:
        - Can't store it in repo
        - Best solution would be to store it on the gitlab-runner and treat is as a test-server
    * Verifying the tests worked without a GUI to manually test
        - Have individual directories for testing the functions (delete dups, blurry, etc..)
        - Have duplicate hashes saved in the test, and verify they were removed after the function ran
            - Do this for unit and large integration tests
        - Have blurry hashes saved in the test, and verify they were removed after the function ran
            - Do this for unit and large integration tests
        - Have # of pics that should be organized in each directory by time
            - Do this for unit and large integration tests
3. Add argparse instead of the junky way I do adding options now
